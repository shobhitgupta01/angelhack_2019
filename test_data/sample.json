{"id": 1, "text": "ISLAMABAD: Defence budget during the next fiscal year will remain unchanged as compared to the outgoing fiscal year in rupee terms due to the country\u2019s dire economic condition.  \nPrime Minister Imran Khan took to Twitter on the eve of Eidul Fitr to announce that the military had \u201cvoluntarily agreed\u201d to cut its expenditures due to \u201ccritical financial situation\u201d. He noted the continuing \u201cmultiple security challenges\u201d and pledged to spend the saved amount on development of the erstwhile tribal areas, which have been merged into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan.  \nChief of the Army Staff Gen Qamar Bajwa, while talking to troops during a visit to the Line of Control on Eid day, said the armed forces were \u201cforegoing routine increase in annual defence budget\u201d.  \nThe defence budget freeze will be for one year.  \nThe original budgetary allocation for the outgoing fiscal year (2018-19) was Rs1.1 trillion. The allocation made up 21 per cent of last year\u2019s original budget outlay and 3.2pc of gross domestic product (GDP).  \n\nPM says military \u2018voluntarily agreed\u2019 to cut its expenditures due to \u2018critical financial situation\u2019; army chief states impact will be managed by \u2018tightening belt\u2019  \n\nThe actual expenditure incurred on defence this year will, however, be announced by the finance ministry while laying the budget for next year (2019-20) before the National Assembly on June 11. The figure will, however, not give the complete picture of the defence budget as it will not include Rs260 billion for pension of retired soldiers, Rs45bn for security enhancement and undeclared allocations for major weapon procurements and strategic programme.  \nAlthough the budget figures will remain static, in reality it will mean lesser available money for the troops due to devaluation of the rupee and inflation; and hence it is being described as cut in defence expenditure.  \nLittle details are officially available about the impact of the budget freeze that comes against the backdrop of the government\u2019s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $6bn bailout package.  \nThe IMF, while announcing the staff-level agreement last month, said the forthcoming budget would aim for a primary deficit of 0.6pc of GDP. The primary deficit is expected to be little over 2pc during the outgoing fiscal year ending on June 30. The IMF had said the reduction in deficit would be achieved through taxation measures, including elimination of exemptions, curtailment of special treatments and improvement in the tax administration. It had, however, long been speculated by financial analysts that the government would be forced to cut all expenditures, including defence spending.  \nMilitary sources say there will be no arms procurement during the next fiscal year, expenditure on rations/TA&DA will be cut, overheads will be rationalised and there wouldn\u2019t be pay raise for officers due to the freeze.  \nGen Bajwa in his interaction with troops on the LoC said the impact would be managed by \u201ctightening our belt\u201d in areas where it did not affect operational capacity. \u201cIrrespective of the voluntary cut in defence budget in the upcoming financial year, there shall be no impact on our response potential to all types of threat and quality of life of the soldiers,\u201d he said.  \nIndian media slammed \nThe military\u2019s spokesman, meanwhile, lashed out at the way Indian media presented the cut in defence expenditures. \u201cIndian fake media busy spinning on our internal defence budgeting choice. Don\u2019t forget, we were the same forces with same budget on 27 Feb 19. We have the capability and capacity to respond. Remember, it\u2019s not budgeting, it\u2019s resolve of force and the nation firmly standing behind its forces,\u201d ISPR director general tweeted from his official account.  \nThe defence budget has grown consistently over the past decade by an average of about 11pc per annum with two exceptions \u2014 2013-14, the first year of PML-N government, when it spiked by 15pc, and 2018-19, PML-N government\u2019s last budget, when it increased by around 18pc over the previous year\u2019s original allocation.  \nMeanwhile, the share of defence budget as percentage of GDP has increased from 2.3pc in 2014-15 to 3.2pc in the budget for 2018-19. Calculating the defence budget as percentage of GDP shows its burden on the national economy.\nPublished in Dawn, June 8th, 2019\n\n"}
