WordNet Domains and SentiWords
==============================

This repository contains a copy of WordNet Domains 3.2 and SentiWords 1.0
as distributed by the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK). Apart from the addition
of this file, ``README.rst``, both are entirely unmodified.

According to `its website <http://wndomains.fbk.eu/download.html>`_,

Unported License <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/>`_.
SentiWords is distributed under the `Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported

I (Lars Buitinck) am not affiliated with FBK or the WordNet Domains project in
any way. I just set up this repository to save others the trouble of the slow
FBK download request procedure.
